# Welcome to software-architecture-tools

List of tools create documents, diagrams and tools to help in Software architecture.

The main focus is to have a list of online tools that don't depends install anything in  your local machine, also are only free tools or partially free to be able get some value without pay and maybe buy if was interesting to some team/project.

Sometimes I need for an specific tool  but I don't remeber the url/name in that moment this list will be something like a remeber list :)
